## [v1.3.4] - 2023-09-07
 
Changes were made on the RKEEL package so the RKEELjars package is no longer necessary.
The functionality of the RKEEL package itself does not change, only the way in which KEEL jars are downloaded.
 
### Added
- Added getExePath.R, getJarList.R, and getJarPath.r from old RKEELjars package, so the RKEEL package knows the routes to the jar and exe files.
- Added zzz.R file from old RKEELjars package, so jars from KEEL are checked and/or downloaded when the package is loaded; a MD5 sum check has been also included.

## [v1.3.3] - 2021-05-10

### Fixed
- Modified writeDatFromDataframe, writeDatFromDataframes, and getAttributeLinesFromDataframes methods to solve problems when reading datasets with integer values. Previously, sometimes these values were stored as real; now they should be stored as integer.

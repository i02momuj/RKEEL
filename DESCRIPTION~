Description: KEEL is a popular Java software for a large number of different knowledge data discovery tasks.
    This package takes the advantages of KEEL and R, allowing to use KEEL algorithms in simple R code.
    The implemented R code layer between R and KEEL makes easy both using KEEL algorithms in R as implementing new algorithms for RKEEL in a very simple way.
    It includes more than 100 algorithms for classification, regression and preprocess, which allows a more complete experimentation process.
